This is a work in progress



this is simple sprinkler timer for me track my collected rain water
and use cheep solinod valves to control my drip iragation system
and allow me to expand as needed while also offering the ability to add sensors
for temp humidity soil moisture and light

most of this will also be tracked on a data service like thingspeak or something
evenutally be able to adjust the the amount of water the plants get based on the
data recived and forcast weather

this project is a learning project I know very little programming before starting this and am hoping to use this to continue to grow my skills and evolve this and some other projects I have together
